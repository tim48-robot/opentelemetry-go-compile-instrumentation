## Development

### Prerequisites

This project uses several tools for development. Most tools will be automatically installed when you first run the corresponding `make` target. However, you need to have:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.26 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Make (usually pre-installed on macOS and Linux)

### Getting Started

> **Windows/WSL contributors:** make sure `core.autocrlf` is `false` before
> cloning (`git config --global core.autocrlf false`). CI runs on Windows as
> well as Linux and macOS, and a clone with `core.autocrlf` enabled checks out
> source files with CRLF line endings. That changes how blank lines are
> preserved when the AST-based code generator writes output, which then fails
> to match the (LF) golden files under `testdata/golden`, even though the
> generated code is correct. If you already cloned with `autocrlf` on, re-clone
> after changing the setting rather than trying to fix the line endings of an
> existing checkout.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
   cd opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
   ```

2. Configure the git merge driver for the instrumentation bundle (run once per clone):

   ```sh
   make setup-git
   ```

   `tool/data/otelc-bundle.tgz` is a binary archive generated from `pkg/` and
   `instrumentation/`, so git cannot merge it and it conflicts on almost every
   rebase. This registers a merge driver that keeps the current bundle instead
   of stopping the rebase/merge; you then refresh it with `make package`. See
   [Keeping the bundle in sync](#keeping-the-bundle-in-sync).

3. Build the project:

   ```sh
   make build
   ```

4. Run tests:

   ```sh
   make test
   ```

### Available Make Targets

Run `make help` to see all available targets:

```sh
make help
```

#### Build Targets

- `make build` - Build the instrumentation tool (includes packaging)
- `make install` - Install the `otelc` binary to `$GOPATH/bin`
- `make package` - Package the instrumentation code into a binary archive
- `make build-demo-grpc` - Build gRPC demo server and client

#### Code Quality

- `make format` - Format all code (Go + YAML + License Headers)
  - `make format/go` - Format Go code only using golangci-lint
  - `make format/yaml` - Format YAML files only using yamlfmt
- `make lint` - Run all linters (Go, YAML, GitHub Actions, Makefile)
  - `make lint/go` - Run golangci-lint on Go code
  - `make lint/yaml` - Lint YAML formatting
  - `make lint/action` - Lint GitHub Actions workflows
  - `make lint/makefile` - Lint Makefile
  - `make lint/license-header` - Check license headers (has dedicated CI workflow)
  - `make lint/license-header/fix` - Apply license headers to Go and shell files

#### License Headers

All Go and shell files must include the proper license header. The required headers and path exclusions are managed in `.github/scripts/license-check.sh`.

To check and fix license headers:

- **Check license headers**: `make lint/license-header`
- **Apply license headers**: `make lint/license-header/fix`

The license header checker has a dedicated CI workflow (`check-license-headers.yaml`) that runs automatically on pull requests and pushes when Go files or the license configuration change.

#### Testing

- `make test` - Run all tests (unit + integration)
- `make test-unit` - Run unit tests only with formatted output
- `make test-integration` - Run integration tests only with formatted output
- `make test-e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
- `make test-latestlibbuild` - Build instrumented test apps against the `@latest` version of each instrumented library
- `make test-latestlibrun` - Bump instrumented test apps to `@latest` and run the full integration suite

Test results are saved to `gotest-unit.log` and `gotest-integration.log` for review.

#### Documentation

- `make docs` - Update embedded documentation in markdown files

#### Semantic Conventions

- `make weaver-install` - Install OTel Weaver if not present
- `make lint/semantic-conventions` - Validate semantic convention registry
- `make semantic-conventions/diff` - Generate diff between two versions of semantic convention registry
- `make semantic-conventions/resolve` - Resolve semantic convention registry schema

For detailed information on managing semantic conventions, see [docs/semantic-conventions.md](docs/semantic-conventions.md).

#### GitHub Actions Security

- `make ratchet/pin` - Pin GitHub Actions to specific commit SHAs for security
- `make ratchet/update` - Update pinned GitHub Actions to latest versions
- `make ratchet/check` - Verify all GitHub Actions are properly pinned

#### Cleanup

- `make clean` - Remove all build artifacts and temporary files

### Development Workflow

A typical development workflow looks like:

1. Make your changes
2. Format your code: `make format`
3. Run linters: `make lint`
4. Run tests: `make test`
5. Commit your changes

For a complete check before submitting a PR, run:

```sh
make all
```

This will run: `build`, `format`, `lint`, and `test` in sequence.

### Keeping the bundle in sync

`tool/data/otelc-bundle.tgz` is a reproducible archive of `pkg/` and
`instrumentation/` that is embedded into `otelc` via `//go:embed`. It must stay
committed so that `go install go.opentelemetry.io/otelc/tool/cmd/otelc@latest`
works, but because it is binary, git cannot 3-way merge it — so any branch that
touches the sources conflicts with `main` on this file.

To make this painless, run `make setup-git` once per clone (see
[Getting Started](#getting-started)). It registers a custom merge driver
(defined in `.gitattributes` + `.github/scripts/merge-bundle.sh`) that keeps the
current ("ours") bundle on conflict so the rebase/merge runs to completion
without stopping. You then regenerate the bundle from the fully-merged sources:

```sh
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main   # no longer halts on the bundle
make package             # regenerate tool/data/otelc-bundle.tgz from merged sources
git add tool/data/otelc-bundle.tgz && git commit --amend --no-edit
git push --force-with-lease
```

Why the driver doesn't regenerate the bundle for you: when git invokes a merge
driver it has not yet written the *other* merged source files to the working
tree, so running `make package` at that moment would embed stale sources and
miss the incoming changes. Regenerating after the rebase/merge completes is the
only reliable point, hence the explicit `make package` step above.

Notes:

- GitHub's "This branch has conflicts" indicator is computed server-side and
  does **not** use your local merge driver. Rebase locally as above and push;
  the conflict disappears once your branch is up to date.
- The `verify-bundle` CI guarantees the committed bundle matches the sources, so
  a forgotten `make package` fails CI rather than shipping a stale bundle.
  Maintainers can also comment `/regenerate-bundle` on a PR to auto-fix it.

### Tools

The following development tools are used and will be automatically installed on first use:

- **[golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)** - Go linter aggregator
- **[gotestfmt](https://github.com/gotesttools/gotestfmt)** - Prettier test output
- **[yamlfmt](https://github.com/google/yamlfmt)** - YAML formatter
- **[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint)** - GitHub Actions linter
- **[ratchet](https://github.com/sethvargo/ratchet)** - GitHub Actions security pinning
- **[embedmd](https://github.com/campoy/embedmd)** - Embed code in markdown files

### Architecture Decision Records

Significant architectural decisions are documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/). Read them to understand *why* the project is structured the way it is.

Create a new ADR when proposing:

- Changes to the instrumentation API or hook model
- New external dependencies or replacements
- Changes to the two-phase build process
- Any decision the SIG discusses and reaches consensus on

To create a new ADR:

```sh
make adr-new TITLE="Title of Your Decision"
```

This requires `adr-tools` (`npryce/adr-tools`). Run `make adr-tools` to install it. To list existing ADRs:

```sh
make adr-list
```

## AI Usage

contributing. The critical rule is: **you must understand every line of code you submit.**
Contributors using AI tools are held to the same quality standards as any other contribution.


## Pull Requests

### Conventional Commits

Pull requests made to this repository are expected to use the [Conventional Commits][conv-commit]
specification. Specifically, pull request titles are required to follow the specification's title
format:

```
<type>(<scope>)!: <description>
╰─┬──╯╰───┬───╯│  ╰─────┬─────╯
  │       │    │        ╰─ Short description of the change (see below)
  │       │    ╰─ If, and only if the PR contains breaking changes
  │       ╰─ Optional: change scope (e.g, 'cmd/otelc', `pkg/weaver`, ...)
  ╰─ Required: commit type (see below for accepted values)
```

This repository requires using one of the following commit types:

- `chore` for routine repository maintenance that has no impact on the user interfaces (CI/CD
  operations, linter configuration, etc...)
- `doc` or `docs` for documentation changes
- `feat` for introduction of new features
- `fix` for bug fixes
- `release` when cutting a new release
- `refactor` for code changes that do not add new features or fix bugs
- `test` for changes to tests or test infrastructure

Please try to keep the commit title concise, yet specific: they are used to derive the release notes
for this repository. A good litmus test for whether a pull request title is suitable or not is to
determine whether a user would be able to determine whether this change affects them or not by just
looking at the title.

Here are some examples for the various supported commit types:

- `chore`:
  - :information_source: What's changing in this PR? This should provide enough information from a
    maintainer to make sense of what's going on.
  - :white_check_mark: `chore(ci): add OSSF Scorecard automation`
  - :x: `chore: new CI step`
- `doc`, `docs`:
  - :information_source: What documentation has change? A user might decide whether they go read it
    or not based on this.
  - :white_check_mark: `docs: explain proper use of the -log-level flag`
  - :x: `docs: improve documentation`
- `feat`:
  - :information_source:  What feature is being introduced specifically? A user might decide if this
    is useful to them or not based on this.
  - :white_check_mark: `feat(cmd/otelc): -log-level flag to configure log verbosity`
  - :x: `feat: logging`
- `fix`:
  - :information_source: What bug is being fixed? Refer to the symptoms of the fixed issue, not to
    the solution. A user might decide whether their problem is solved by a release or not based on
    this.
  - :white_check_mark: `fix: SEGFAULT on when cross-compiling on linux/arm64 platforms`
  - :x: `fix: check pointer for nil before dereferencing it`
- `release`:
  - :information_source: What version is this commit preparing for?
  - :white_check_mark: `release: v1.2.3`
  - :x: `release: new release`
- `refactor`:
  - :information_source: What code is being refactored?
  - :white_check_mark: `refactor: remove unused code`
  - :x: `refactor: improve code readability`

### How to Send Pull Requests

Everyone is welcome to contribute code to `opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation` via
GitHub pull requests (PRs).

To create a new PR, fork the project in GitHub and clone the upstream
repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
```

This would put the project in the `opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation` directory in
current working directory.

Enter the newly created directory and add your fork as a new remote:

```sh
git remote add <YOUR_FORK> git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
```

Check out a new branch, make modifications, run linters and tests, and push
the branch to your fork:

```sh
git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
# edit files
git add -p
git commit
git push <YOUR_FORK> <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>
```

Open a pull request against the main `opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation` repo.

Avoid rebasing and force-pushing to your branch to facilitate reviewing the pull request.
Rewriting Git history makes it difficult to keep track of iterations during code review.
All pull requests are squashed to a single commit upon merge to `main`.

### How to Receive Comments

- If the PR is not ready for review, please put `[WIP]` in the title,
  tag it as `work-in-progress`, or mark it as
  [`draft`](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
- Make sure CLA is signed and CI is clear.

### How to Get PRs Merged

A PR is considered **ready to merge** when:

- It has received two qualified approvals[^1].

  This is not enforced through automation, but needs to be validated by the
  maintainer merging.
  - The qualified approvals need to be from [Approver]s/[Maintainer]s
    affiliated with different companies. Two qualified approvals from
    [Approver]s or [Maintainer]s affiliated with the same company counts as a
    single qualified approval.
  - PRs introducing changes that have already been discussed and consensus
    reached only need one qualified approval. The discussion and resolution
    needs to be linked to the PR.
  - Trivial changes[^2] only need one qualified approval.

- All feedback has been addressed.
  - All PR comments and suggestions are resolved.
  - All GitHub Pull Request reviews with a status of "Request changes" have
    been addressed. Another review by the objecting reviewer with a different
    status can be submitted to clear the original review, or the review can be
    dismissed by a [Maintainer] when the issues from the original review have
    been addressed.
  - Any comments or reviews that cannot be resolved between the PR author and
    reviewers can be submitted to the community [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s
    during the weekly SIG meeting. If consensus is reached among the
    [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s during the SIG meeting the objections to the
    PR may be dismissed or resolved or the PR closed by a [Maintainer].
  - Any substantive changes to the PR require existing Approval reviews be
    cleared unless the approver explicitly states that their approval persists
    across changes. This includes changes resulting from other feedback.
    [Approver]s and [Maintainer]s can help in clearing reviews and they should
    be consulted if there are any questions.

- The PR branch is up to date with the base branch it is merging into.
  - To ensure this does not block the PR, it should be configured to allow
    maintainers to update it.

- It has been open for review for at least one working day. This gives people
  reasonable time to review.
  - Trivial changes[^2] do not have to wait for one day and may be merged with
    a single [Maintainer]'s approval.

- All required GitHub workflows have succeeded.
- Urgent fix can take exception as long as it has been actively communicated
  among [Maintainer]s.

Any [Maintainer] can merge the PR once the above criteria have been met.

[^1]: A qualified approval is a GitHub Pull Request review with "Approve"
  status from an OpenTelemetry Go Compile Instrumentation [Approver] or [Maintainer].
[^2]: Trivial changes include: typo corrections, cosmetic non-substantive
  changes, documentation corrections or updates, dependency updates, etc.
