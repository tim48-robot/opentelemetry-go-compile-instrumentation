# Getting Started

OpenTelemetry Go Compile-Time Instrumentation is a tool that automatically instruments your Go applications with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) at compile-time.
No manual code changes required.

## Why Use This Tool?

- **Zero-code instrumentation** - Automatically instrument your entire application without modifying source code
- **Third-party library support** - Instrument dependencies and libraries you don't control (HTTP, gRPC, database/sql, Redis, OpenAI, Anthropic, and more)
- **Complete decoupling** - Keep your codebase free from instrumentation concerns
- **Flexible deployment** - Integrate at development time or in your CI/CD pipeline

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and build the tool**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation.git
   cd opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation
   make build
   ```

2. **Try the demo**

   ```bash
   cd demo/app/basic
   ../../../otelc go build
   ./basic
   ```

3. **Use with your application**

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Direct build
   ./otelc go build -o myapp .

   # Option 2: Install as tool dependency (Go 1.24+)
   go get -tool go.opentelemetry.io/otelc/tool/cmd/otelc
   go tool otelc go build -o myapp .
   ```

## Using `go build` Directly (toolexec drop-in)

Instead of wrapping the build with `otelc go build`, you can keep using the
regular `go` toolchain and plug `otelc` in through `GOFLAGS`. This is useful
when the build command is owned by a Makefile, CI pipeline, or another tool
you don't want to change.

1. **Prepare the module** (once, and again after dependencies change):

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/module
   otelc setup
   ```

   `otelc setup` analyzes the module, generates the instrumentation sources
   (`otel.instrumentation.go`, `otelc.runtime.go`) and writes the matched
   rules to `.otelc-build/`, which the build phase below reads.

2. **Build with the standard toolchain**:

   ```bash
   export GOFLAGS="${GOFLAGS} '-toolexec=otelc toolexec'"
   go build -o myapp .
   ```

Run `go build` from the module directory (or any subdirectory); `otelc`
locates the `.otelc-build` directory created by `otelc setup` from there. To
run the build from somewhere else, set `OTELC_WORK_DIR` to the directory
where `otelc setup` ran.

Instrumented and plain build artifacts are kept apart in Go's build cache
(otelc marks the tool identity go hashes into every cache key), so switching
between instrumented and regular builds does not require cleaning the cache.

## Managing Instrumentations

Instrumentations are declared through an `otel.instrumentation.go` file located next to the application's `go.mod` file. The alternate filename `otelc.tool.go` is also accepted and behaves identically.

The file follows the standard Go `tools.go` pattern and contains blank imports for the instrumentation packages that should be enabled:

```go
//go:build tools

package tools

import (
	_ "go.opentelemetry.io/otelc/instrumentation/net/http/server" // enable net/http server instrumentation
	_ "go.opentelemetry.io/otelc/instrumentation/github.com/gin-gonic/gin" // enable gin instrumentation
)
```

The file can be created and maintained automatically using:

```bash
otelc pin
```

The `pin` command discovers applicable instrumentations, creates the file if it does not already exist, updates imports, synchronizes dependencies, and runs validation checks.

If no instrumentation file exists, `otelc go build` automatically analyzes the application's dependency graph and generates a temporary instrumentation configuration for the duration of the build. This ensures a zero-configuration workflow while allowing projects to adopt a persistent, source-controlled configuration when desired.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for committing an `otelc pin`-generated `otel.instrumentation.go` file is still under development. Until the work in [#585](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation/issues/585) to decouple instrumentation packages from the `otelc` executable is complete, `otelc pin` should be considered a local workflow. `otelc go build` continues to work without a committed instrumentation file by automatically generating a temporary configuration during the build.

## How It Works

The tool uses compile-time instrumentation through:

1. **Trampoline Code Injection** - Injects lightweight hook points into target functions
2. **Function Pointer Redirection** - Automatically generates and links hooks to monitoring code via `//go:linkname`
3. **Custom Toolchain Integration** - Intercepts compilation using `-toolexec` flag

This approach provides dynamic instrumentation without runtime overhead or invasive code modifications.

## Supported Libraries

The following libraries are automatically instrumented:

| `net/http` (client & server) | HTTP spans |
| `google.golang.org/grpc` (client & server) | gRPC/RPC spans |
| `database/sql` | DB client spans |
| `github.com/gin-gonic/gin` | HTTP server spans |
| `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` | Redis DB spans |
